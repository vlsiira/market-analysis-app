# Market Analysis App

# By Valerie Siira

# Description
This application is intended to aid market researchers for BusMall, a catalog that advertises products to patrons of the Trimet bus system in Portland, Oregon.  The researchers aim to determine which potential products are most marketable.  Through the app, market research participants are shown three of 15 potential products, and instructed to click on the one they would most want to buy.  After each click, randomized products are shown again.  When the user has made 15 selections, a button appears that, when clicked, displays a list of the 15 products and the number of times each was selected.
